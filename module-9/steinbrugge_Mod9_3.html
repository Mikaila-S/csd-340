    <h1>Assignment 9.3 - JavaScript, Part 1</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1: Intro</h2>
    
    <p class="intro"> Hi, my name is Mikaila Steinbrugge. I currently live in Ohio, which is where I have lived my whole life. Unlike what most people think, there is quite a lot to do in Ohio. Near where I am from is The Air Force Museum, which is located on Wright Patterson Air Force Base.</p>
    
    <p> Growing up, I felt like there wasn't much to do other than visiting the Air Force Museum, since we went so often in the summer (it’s free!). I have always enjoyed going to school, talking to friends, and learning new things. However, I have always been indecisive about what I want to do, which is why I took a break from school in 2020.</p>
    
    <p> I don’t do much outside of work and schoolwork. One thing I enjoy is attending concerts. I try to go to as many as I can during the summer. The best concert I have ever been to has to be either <span id="concert1">______</span> or <span id="concert2">______</span>. The crowd at both events was amazing; you never felt <span id="feeling1">______</span> or like you didn’t belong, always feeling <span id="feeling2">______</span>.</p>
