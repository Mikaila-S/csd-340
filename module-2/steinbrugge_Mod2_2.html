    <h2> Chapter 1: Intro</h2>
    <p class="intro"> Hi, my name is Mikaila Steinbrugge. I curently live in Ohio, which is where I have lived my whole life. Unlike what most people think thier is quite alot to do in Ohio, near where I an from is The Air Force Museaum whuch is on Wright Patterson airforce base. </p>
    <p> Growing up I felt like their wasn't much to do other than the Air Force Museaum since we went so often in the summer, since goign is free. I have always liked goign to school and talking to my friends and learning new things, but I have always been indecisive about what I want to do. Which is why I took a break from school in 2020. 
    <p> I don't do much outside of going to work or doing school work. One thing that I enjoy doing is going to concerts, I try to go to as many as I can during the summer. <span class="sentence">The best conert that I have ever been to has to be either Yungblud or Zach Bryan.</span> The crowd during both were amazing you never felt unsafe or like you didnt belong.</p>
